"I have done my graduation in Electronics and Communication and it had Mathematics which helped me in gaining the Statistical and Algebraic knowledge as a base for Data Science. I can fuse the knowledge of EC and Data Science in order to get something very informative and productive out of it. 
Electronics branch needs Data Science in order to interpret the immense consumer chain data in order to work on some new technology as per user demand. Also to modify or update the existing technology with the help of users complains. "


##Based on the videos and the reading material, what are the ten main components of a report that would be delivered at the end of a data science project? (5 marks)
